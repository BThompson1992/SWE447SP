Final Project Proposal
Brett Thompson

Overview:

	My final project will be a web-based EQ visualizer. 
  I’ll be including about 15 cubes that will change size in the y-axis to the beat of a song that I will be choosing ahead of time.
  Each cube will change color to reflect the decibel of the songs various wavelengths. 
  
Implementation Schedule:

•	Week 1 : Render my 15 cubes in an appropriate window
•	Week 2 : Get the necessary documentation to play sound in a web browser
•	Week 3 : Scale to the rhythm of the song
•	Week 4 : Texture the cubes to change color to the song
•	Week 5 : Work out bugs and (Stretch Goal) add a way to switch songs

Intended Implementation:

	I will create a web-based EQ visualizer using THREE.js
